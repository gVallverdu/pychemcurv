# dash-mosaica

Dash application for the Mosaica project: https://pychemapps.univ-pau.fr/mosaica/

This application aims to visualize structural data in order to provide a geometrical
analysis of a molecular structure. It also provides a way to visualize any 
atomic quantities. The application is part of the
[pychemcurv](https://github.com/gVallverdu/pychemcurv) project and will be move
soon in this repository.
